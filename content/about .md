I am Xiaodong Feng, a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Iowa State University, College of Veterinary Medicine. I was born in Tonghua, a small city which is located in Jilin Province, northeast China. I got my bachelorâ€™s degree in Veterinary Medicine from China Agricultural University in 2018. I had a good time in CAU and also got familiar with Beijing because of my undergrad life. I have many hobbies and I will not name them one by one here. I was born to be adventurous. Here, I may mainly record my random thoughts, travel and reading notes.

**Hope I like it.**
