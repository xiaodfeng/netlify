One of the most eye opening of the solipsistic world of females was when a plate of mine was giving me directions on where to pick her up. It went something like this: Her: “When you come to that traffic light, turn over to me.” Me: “What do you mean?” Her: “Just turn here towards me.” Me: “How the hell am I supposed to know which way is that? Left or right?” Her: “I don’t know. Just turn my way”She eventually gave directions, but it amazed me how hard it is for a woman to put herself in someone else’s shoes, even if she wants to.
