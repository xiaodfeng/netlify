## Alpha Diversity

Alpha diversity ($\alpha$-diversity) is defined as the mean diversity of species in different sites or habitats within a local scale. 


#### Species Richness

Species richness, which the count of the number of species or operational taxonomic units (OTUs) or Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) present in an area, is the simplest measure of alpha diversity.

#### Species Evenness

Species evenness refers to how close in numbers each species in an environment is.
