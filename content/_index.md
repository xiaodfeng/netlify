I am Xiaodong Feng. A post-doc researcher in University of Groningen. My research project during PhD is improving identification and quantification in metabolomics applying modern data analysis techniques. The goal of this project is to provide a reliable preprocessing tool by improving the open source platforms such as XCMS, and considerably improve the identification process using state of the art data processing techniques such as Bayesian statistics, multivariate analysis and Artificial Intelligence (AI).  The project will focus in improving the state of the previously listed issues initially for the lipidomics and with further potential extend to other metabolomics sub-categories. I like photography, poetry and travelling during my free time.
